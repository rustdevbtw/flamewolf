# RLBox allows automatic handling of differing machine models between the appplication and sandbox.
# To do this, RLBox carefully changes the types of function pointers to the sandbox with ones suitable for the applicaton.
# Unfortunately, this triggers the ubsan's check for calling functions with incorrect types. So disabling this.
