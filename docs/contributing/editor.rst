Editor / IDE integration
========================

You can use any editor or IDE to contribute to Firefox, as long as it can edit
text files. However, there are some steps specific to mozilla-central that may
be useful for a better development experience. This page attempts to document
them.

.. note::

    Visual Studio Code is the recommended editor for Firefox development.
    Not because it is better than the other editors but because we decided to
    focus our energy on a single editor.

.. note::

    This page is a work in progress. Please enhance this page with instructions
    for your favourite editor.
