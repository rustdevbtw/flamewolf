# This is intended to be a really simple imitation of what Gecko's
# display-list around the content scrolling viewport.  In addition to the
# scroll-frame's clip (added by clip-to-frame) it also adds equivalent clips
# to everything inside, including inside the stacking context.  The stacking
# context with partial opacity acts as a regression test for bug 1836063.
