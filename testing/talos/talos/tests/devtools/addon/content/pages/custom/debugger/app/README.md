## Create React Test App 
This is a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) that is
being used as part of the DAMP test tool suite. Files in `src` can be modified freely.

This package assumes yarn is installed.

This `app` is built into `app-build/` folder which is used for the damp tests

To build and copy this `app`:
- Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies
- Make any needed changes in the `src` or `public` folders
- Run `yarn copy-assets` to re build the `app`
