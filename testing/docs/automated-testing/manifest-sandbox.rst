Adding Context to ``manifestparser`` based Manifests
----------------------------------------------------

Suites that use ``manifestparser``, like Mochitest and XPCShell, have test
manifests that denote whether a given test should be skipped or not based
on a set of context.

Gecko builds generate a ``target.mozinfo.json`` with metadata about the build.
An example ``target.mozinfo.json`` might look like :download:`this
<target.mozinfo.json>`. These keys can then be used ``skip-if`` in test manifests:

.. code-block::

   skip-if = e10s && os == 'win'

In this case, ``e10s`` is a boolean.

The test will download the build's ``target.mozinfo.json``, then update the
mozinfo dictionary with additional runtime information based on the task or
runtime environment. This logic lives in `mozinfo
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/testing/mozbase/mozinfo/mozinfo/mozinfo.py>`__.

How to Add a Keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where to add the new key depends on what type of information it is.

1. If the key is a property of the build, you'll need to patch `this file
   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/mozinfo.py>`_.
2. If the key is a property of the test environment, you'll need to patch
   `mozinfo <https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/mozbase/mozinfo.html>`_.
3. If the key is a runtime configuration, for example based on a pref that is
   passed in via mach or the task configuration, then you'll need to update the
   individual test harnesses. For example, `this location
   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a7e33b7f61e7729e2b1051d2a7a27799f11a5de6/testing/mochitest/runtests.py#3341>`_
   for Mochitest. Currently there is no shared location to set runtime keys
   across test harnesses.

Adding a Context to Reftest Style Manifests
-------------------------------------------

Reftests and Crashtests use a different kind of manifest, but the general idea
is the same.

As before, Gecko builds generate a ``target.mozinfo.json`` with metadata about
the build. An example ``target.mozinfo.json`` might look like :download:`this
<target.mozinfo.json>`. This is consumed in the Reftest harness and translated
into keywords that can be used like:

.. code-block::

   fuzzyIf(cocoaWidget&&isDebugBuild,1-1,85-88)

In this case, ``cocoaWidget`` and ``isDebugbuild`` are booleans.

The test will download the build's ``target.mozinfo.json``, then in addition to
the mozinfo, will query runtime info from the browser to build a sandbox of
keywords. This logic lives in `manifest.sys.mjs
<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/tools/reftest/manifest.sys.mjs#439>`__.

   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/mozinfo.py>`_.
2. If the key is a property of the test environment or a runtime configuration,
   then you'll need need to update manifest sandbox.

For example, for Apple Silicon, we can add an ``apple_silicon`` keyword with a
patch like this:

.. code-block:: diff

    --- a/layout/tools/reftest/manifest.sys.mjs
    +++ b/layout/tools/reftest/manifest.sys.mjs
    @@ -572,16 +572,18 @@ function BuildConditionSandbox(aURL) {

        // Set OSX to be the Mac OS X version, as an integer, or undefined
        // for other platforms.  The integer is formed by 100 times the
        // major version plus the minor version, so 1006 for 10.6, 1010 for
        // 10.10, etc.
        var osxmatch = /Mac OS X (\d+).(\d+)$/.exec(hh.oscpu);
        sandbox.OSX = osxmatch ? parseInt(osxmatch[1]) * 100 + parseInt(osxmatch[2]) : undefined;

    +   sandbox.apple_silicon = sandbox.cocoaWidget && sandbox.OSX>=11;
    +
        // Plugins are no longer supported.  Don't try to use TestPlugin.
        sandbox.haveTestPlugin = false;

        // Set a flag on sandbox if the windows default theme is active
        sandbox.windowsDefaultTheme = g.containingWindow.matchMedia("(-moz-windows-default-theme)").matches;

        try {
            sandbox.nativeThemePref = !prefs.getBoolPref("widget.disable-native-theme-for-content");


Then to use this:

.. code-block::

    fuzzy-if(apple_silicon,1-1,281-281) == frame_above_rules_none.html frame_above_rules_none_ref.html
