    Newtab-related instrumentation.
    Can be disabled via the `newtabPingEnabled` variable of the `glean` Nimbus
    feature, or the `browser.newtabpage.ping.enabled` pref.

    newtab_session_end: |
      The newtab visit ended.

    component_init: |
      The newtab component init'd,
      and the newtab and homepage settings have been categorized.
      This is mostly to ensure we hear at least once from clients configured to
      not show a newtab UI.
