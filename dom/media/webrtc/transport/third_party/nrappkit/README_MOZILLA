This import of nrappkit is a subset of the distribution at:

  nrappkit.sourceforge.net


The last revision included in this import was on Nov 25, 2008, version 1.0b2.

The upstream project is now dead (no update since 2013), we can conisder this
version as a fork.

Out of the list in the README, we use:

- registry-based configuration (with change callbacks)
  [but without the registry daemon]
- configurable logging system
- event and timer handling
  [though partly reimplemented]

Also, we use a bunch of the generic utilities such as string handling,
generic hash tables in C, yet another concrete type mapping, etc.
